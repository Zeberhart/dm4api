This may be zero or negative if the event was generated for a non-visible ""character"", such as an arrow or Function key. In that case you can act upon the keycode field.\n\nSome special keys will set the unichar field to their standard ASCII values: Tab=9, Return=13, Escape=27. In addition if you press the Control key together with A to Z the unichar field will have the values 1 to 26. For example Ctrl-A will set unichar to 1 and Ctrl-H will set it to 8.\n\nAs of Allegro 5.0.2 there are some inconsistencies in the treatment of Backspace (8 or 127) and Delete (127 or 0) keys on different platforms. These can be worked around by checking the keycode field.\n\nkeyboard.modifiers (unsigned)\nThis is a bitfield of the modifier keys which were pressed when the event occurred.
